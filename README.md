### Method
- I was inspired by this [Sakana project](https://sakana.ai/evolutionary-model-merge/)

### Framework
[ ModelSelector ] > [ Finetunner ] > [ Merger ] > [ Evaluator ]   

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Finetunner
    participant ModelSelector
    participant Merger
    participant Evaluator
    ModelSelector->>Finetunner: Select the Random One
    Finetunner->>Merger: Select the Highest Two
    loop ScoreChecker
        ModelSelector->>Merger: Highest two
        Merger->>Evaluator: Merged one
        Evaluator->>Merger: If the score is lower
    end
```

### Process
Required two models with the same architecture.   

1. Original model > DPO + SFT > Gapped model   
2. SLERP Original one and Gapped one > Merged   
3. Evaluate > Merged   
* Fine-tune a specific evaluation part of the model if you need to increase the score for that part   
4. SLERP Merged one and Original One > Second Merged   
5. Evaluate Second Merged   
@ Continue until the average evaluation score is higher than the original one
